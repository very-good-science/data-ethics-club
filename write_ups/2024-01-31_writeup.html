<div class="admonition-what-s-this admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What‚Äôs this?</p>
<p>This is a summary of Wednesday 31st January‚Äôs Data Ethics Club discussion, where we spoke and wrote about the Washington Post article <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/10/duolingo-ai-layoffs/">Duolingo cuts workers as it relies more on AI</a> by Gerrit de Vynck.
The summary was written by Jessica Woodgate, who tried to synthesise everyone‚Äôs contributions to this document and the discussion. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù = ‚Äúsomeone at Data Ethics Club‚Äù.
Nina Di Cara Natalie Thurlby, Vanessa Hanschke, Amy Joint and Huw Day helped with the final edit.</p>
</div>
<p>The Washington Post article covered the news that in 2023, 10% of Duolingo‚Äôs contractors had their jobs terminated. These were primarily translators who were writing content for lessons across the language learning site‚Äôs programmes, and although Duolingo has said that employees wouldn‚Äôt be replaced by AI, that instead AI is being used to improve productivity and efficiency, and that no fully AI-generated sentences have been deployed on the app, previous employees have noted a drop in quality of the content released since last year. Contractors who have been kept on have seen their roles shift to reviewing content rather than creating content for lessons - similarly, it has been found worldwide that the number of adverts for freelance ‚Äúautomation-prone‚Äù roles fell by 21% after the introduction of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Below are some key points discussed during the Data Ethics Club session:</p>
<section id="should-companies-be-upheld-to-legal-and-ethical-requirements-to-notify-their-employees-that-they-are-looking-into-ai-driven-solutions-to-replace-their-roles-how-would-this-work-in-practice">
<h2>Should companies be upheld to legal and ethical requirements to notify their employees that they are looking into AI-driven solutions to replace their roles? How would this work in practice?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-companies-be-upheld-to-legal-and-ethical-requirements-to-notify-their-employees-that-they-are-looking-into-ai-driven-solutions-to-replace-their-roles-how-would-this-work-in-practice" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>One way to think about this is by asking ourselves whether employees should be informed when they might be replaced by another person. If employees should be notified when they might be replaced by a person, then they should also be notified when they might be replaced by AI. Requiring companies to notify employees might be easier to impose on government organisations than private companies, as it can be harder to hold private companies to account.</p>
<p>Duolingo‚Äôs layoffs highlight the power imbalance between temporary contractors and the company itself. It is an accepted part of the role that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/2/9/23591549/tech-freelance-contract-independent-work-layoffs">as a contract worker, you could be laid off at any time</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/inside-googles-shadow-workforce/">‚Äúshadow work force‚Äù</a> refers to the practice of big tech companies hiring contract workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits, and less security. This has colonial roots, where contract workers experience inferior treatment to other employees, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html">has been compared to the caste system</a>. These practices and the ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù are becoming increasingly central to business models, with Google having roughly 102,000 full time workers and 121,000 temporary workers in 2019. Replacing roles with transient workers or AI removes the opportunity for workers to develop skills for other roles. If a company or tool cannot exist without exploitation, we do not think it should exist at all.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/07/what-is-the-post-office-horizon-it-scandal-all-about">Post Office scandal</a> is a great example of push back against decisions to use inadequate tools which save money. This incites questions of where the responsibility lies for regulating AI. Providing compensation for those wrongfully accused by the Post Office <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/post-office-it-scandal-politicians-blame">has been painfully slow</a>, and responsibility is so dispersed that <a class="reference external" href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/post-office-scandal-minister-says-223843455.html">no-one has been properly held to account</a>. The technology itself seems to be a figure of blame, isolated from those who develop and deploy it. We feel it is important that actual people are held to account.</p>
<p>Questions also emerge surrounding how job replacement links to data ownership. AI has led to the introduction of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-user-reports-improve-course-content/">content reviewer roles</a>. We wondered if these roles are permanent or just a stop-gap to be replaced when enough data has been gathered/AI has improved enough to adopt these roles as well. If the data of employees (e.g. content reviewers) are used to train AI which later replaces them, this becomes ethically questionable. Data that employees produce is often owned by the company, and we wondered about the ethics of how this data gets used. For example, we have found that videos put online by lecturers during the pandemic have continued to be used by the university after the lecturer has passed away. The ability of someone deceased to consent to their data being shared makes this ethically questionable, even if the university has rights over the data. Perhaps some sort of royalty system could improve practices surrounding employee data creation and use.</p>
<p>Replacing human employees with AI is not always appropriate; in the case of learning languages, it might be true that an AI-developed course is better than no course, but we wondered if it is good enough for real learning. If students just want to learn basic foundations, it could suffice. However, if they want to develop a higher level of proficiency and language skills that can be used in practice with native speakers, AI might not be good enough. The problem isn‚Äôt just that people are learning languages wrong, it is the assumption that we can replace human knowledge and experience with an AI tool. We don‚Äôt sit children in front of AI to teach them how to talk; educational psychology is very important. Whilst noting that teaching children is very different to teach adults, we can still accept that structure and interaction are key parts of learning. Knowing the corresponding words does not equate to knowing a language.</p>
<p>Using AI for translation is not new (<a class="reference external" href="https://alexmoltzau.medium.com/the-history-of-google-translate-fcbe9de3c10e">Google Translate has been doing it for years</a>), but there are still a lot of issues with it. When we use phrases we have learnt from Duolingo in real life, sometimes those we are speaking to will say the phrase is technically ‚Äúright‚Äù, but odd. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQl6jUjFjp4">Duolingo‚Äôs content comes from real sources</a>, so the wording of phrases is sometimes weird. For example, one of the Polish phrases it teaches is ‚ÄúI am sad even though I am drinking wine‚Äù. It seems that odd but technically correct phrases are becoming more common place.</p>
<p>The proliferation of AI in language generation will change spoken language globally. AI is colonising the internet by generating content which is disproportionately trained on data from the ‚Äúglobal north‚Äù. This pollutes future training data, eroding cultural nuances. Phrases may get less interesting and language specific, and we have already seen that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_time_of_extinction">languages and dialects can go extinct</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.languageconnections.com/blog/the-influence-of-english-on-other-languages-and-visa-versa/">The increase in global communication means English terms are increasingly being adopted in other languages</a>. Britishisms leak into American English and vice versa. We wondered what this means for the future of linguistics, and if the English language will converge to some pan-global version. It seems that AI will only accelerate the erosion of language diversity.</p>
<p>Language is fluid, changing between contexts and over time. To utilise AI as a language teacher, companies need to ensure it stays up to date. This raises questions about what human reviewers are targeting in their reviews ‚Äì whether they are looking at the correctness of the structure, or if they are situating it in the bigger picture to examine if it is actually useful. <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-user-reports-improve-course-content/">Relying on users to report errors</a> rather than expert opinion might not be the most effective methodology. Not all observed errors will be reported and, as users, we‚Äôve found that when we do report errors it takes months before we get a response. It can be difficult to detect when AI is wrong; using AI to check AI can result in bad feedback loops where they are learning from one another‚Äôs mistakes. It seems better that AI is compared to a human baseline.</p>
<p>There are also problems with the variety of languages implemented in Duolingo, as a lot of less ‚Äúpopular‚Äù languages aren‚Äôt included. For instance, you <a class="reference external" href="https://learnlanguagesfromhome.com/duolingo-albanian/">cannot learn Albanian</a> but you <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17123836/duolingo-klingon-star-trek-learning-course-app-website-qapla">can learn Klingon</a>. This emphasises an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/african-language-ai-bias/">imbalance between dominant languages (like English) and less dominant languages</a>. Replacing human oversight with AI will only perpetuate these inequalities. Without humans to draw attention to excluded areas, AI will just reinforce what it already has learnt, widening the gap.</p>
<p>If the fluidity of languages and imbalance of coverage is mitigated, AI <em>could</em> teach language better than humans. Human translators might be stuck in the version of the language they learnt when they were growing up, whereas AI isn‚Äôt necessarily attached to a certain era of language evolution. There is a general assumption that using AI instead of human prompts would be worse, but <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">this might not be the case</a>. For instance, there are aspects of LLMs which arguably do better than google search now.</p>
<p>For AI to be successful, the focus needs to be on quality rather than quantity; language acquisition above the number of subscribers. Changing incentive systems in the workplace to reflect this might encourage better practices. It is important to know what people want from the app. The design of Duolingo is gamified, so that users are encouraged to maximise their score, becoming more involved with getting long streaks than actually learning. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQl6jUjFjp4">Collecting data from learners was the key motivation for Duolingo‚Äôs creation</a> (whose founder Luis van Ahn also founded <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">reCAPTCHA</a>) which <a class="reference external" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/01/22/crowdsourcing-capitalists-how-duolingos-founders-offered-free-education-to-millions/?sh=4930223aa725">some argue is exploitative</a>. Even if we accept business models centred around data collection, there should be a minimum requirement of transparency and people should be kept in the loop with company practices.</p>

<h2>Are there any circumstances where it could be considered ethical to lay off a small proportion of employees within a company for the benefit of the wider organisation?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-there-any-circumstances-where-it-could-be-considered-ethical-to-lay-off-a-small-proportion-of-employees-within-a-company-for-the-benefit-of-the-wider-organisation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>It is important to think about what the differences are between a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù redundancy process and the replacement of human employees with AI, which might not necessarily be up for the task. In the case of AI, the intention seems to be to save money and inflate profits, not improve the quality of service. However, this might not be unusual; we see a pattern of job loss repeated every time a new technology comes through (e.g. cars, the printing press).</p>
<p>We would like to think that it is never ethical to lay off employees, however, the issue is not clear cut. On one hand, layoffs are to benefit the company not to the employees - costs are reduced, and stock price goes up. On the other hand, if nobody is laid off, benefits and wages might have to be slashed because the company has less money. For example, in some consultancies <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90500004/pandemic-pay-cuts-the-growing-list-of-companies-reducing-salaries-during-covid-19">all staff took a pay cut during the pandemic</a>. We aren‚Äôt sure if this is a better alternative, and wondered if wages tend to return to their prior rates.</p>
<p>Reduction in wages or threat of redundancy might require people to upskill in order to keep their value as employees. We wondered how much personal responsibility people have to upskill, or to know what they should be upskilling in. Good managers would be on top of this, thinking about continuity and the development of their employees as a part of the development of the company. We feel most fulfilled in environments where we are supported and guided to improve, and this pays out in the quality of our work.</p>

<h2>Legislation and guidance around AI regulation such as the UK‚Äôs National AI strategy focuses on the creation of new jobs to integrate AI, rather than the protection of existing ones - what more should be done at this level and at a corporate level to support this?<a class="headerlink" href="#legislation-and-guidance-around-ai-regulation-such-as-the-uks-national-ai-strategy-focuses-on-the-creation-of-new-jobs-to-integrate-ai-rather-than-the-protection-of-existing-ones-what-more-should-be-done-at-this-level-and-at-a-corporate-level-to-support-this" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This type of regulation risks encouraging managers to use AI rather than employ humans. Currently, these decisions are not made transparently. We would like to see the introduction of processes which companies have to go through to obtain permission to replace human employees to AI. Employees should have more say in the continuation of their jobs; it is worrying that certain types of jobs may be made unavailable. It would be more acceptable if people are aware and engaged in the process. To take these jobs away could mean that those working in them do not have another job or livelihood; this situation reminds us of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-50069336">what happened to the mining industry</a>.</p>
<p>Retaining jobs for people can be aided by implementing AI as an assistive mechanism, rather than a complete replacement for a human employee. Rather than replacing a ‚Äúfull worker‚Äù, AI can cover some of the responsibilities of multiple different people. A subset of tasks is removed, instead of an entire role. This means that the job doesn‚Äôt vanish, but tasks are merged and responsibilities combined. AI just becomes another tool we are using.</p>
<p>Whether a job is replaced by AI or just updated might depend on what the job is. For instance, if the job is mainly content generation, this could easily be replaced by AI. If the human role becomes checking the content which AI produced, this arguably becomes a completely new and different job. In the case of Duolingo, rather than creatively designing lessons, the job becomes prompt engineering. We had some quality concerns with how AI replaces human input. Skilled workers join companies because they have abilities which they have honed and want to do a good job. However, tools are introduced to do these tasks which often perform more poorly than the skilled worker.</p>
<p>On the other hand, prompt engineering is a skill in itself, and the combination of human and AI could result in something much better than a human on their own. Perhaps the issue is actually just semantics; we might compare it to the transition of editors from typewriters to desktop computers. It is also important to consider that changes in job structure might not just be because of AI ‚Äì environmental sustainability requirements will have an effect.</p>

<p>There is an interest in using AI for mental health chatbots; <a class="reference external" href="http://eliza.botlibre.com/">Eliza</a>, one of the first chatbots, was an attempt to simulate a psychotherapist. This might be appropriate, for example, as a space for people to talk about problems they wish to be confidential. On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ax9yw/startup-uses-ai-chatbot-to-provide-mental-health-counseling-and-then-realizes-it-feels-weird">people find AI counsellors ‚Äúweird‚Äù</a> suggesting they might not be up for the task.</p>
<p>Transparency is essential for chatbots; it must be clear whether you are interacting with a human or with AI. What happens with the data from these transactions must also be transparent. At Crisis Text Line, data has been used to <a class="reference external" href="https://mashable.com/article/loris-empathy-training-to-customer-service-evolution">improve the emphatic ability of customer service company Loris AI</a>. This started with the intention of creating empathy training videos, and over the course of its first year morphed into customer service selling tech. There are political issues, exemplified at the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) where AI was used to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7ezkm/eating-disorder-helpline-fires-staff-transitions-to-chatbot-after-unionization">replace workers at an eating disorder helpline, four days after they unionised</a>.</p>
<p>Like the change to the mining industry, it‚Äôs likely that certain jobs will drastically change or reduce, probably involving layoffs. One way these changes might be reflected is through a pay structure where idea generation is cheap, and structural understanding is more highly valued. Proofreading is a very likely candidate for this. Short sighted approaches might look like staff cuts and focus on increasing output, paying less attention to decline in quality. However, jobs like proofreading are very suited to some people, such as those with mobility issues or new parents, and we need to think about how they can be compensated for. It is important to consider ways to save money which don‚Äôt involve cutting employees.</p>

<p>Duolingo might get away with a reduction in quality because they don‚Äôt have many fluent users. We found it disheartening that we might not notice a drop Duolingo quality because we don‚Äôt understand the languages well enough.
