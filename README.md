# Data Ethics Club
:computer: :brain: :bar_chart: :sparkles:

Welcome! Data Ethics Club is a discussion group/"journal" club about doing data science ethically. "Journal" because we will also read blog posts, (parts of) books, or watch videos. The organisers are based in Bristol, but the club is open to all.

We're in the planning stage right now :bug:, so for now:
* enjoy our [reading list](#reading-list).
* [suggest reading materials](#how-to-make-suggestions).
* [get involved in organising](#get-involved).
* [stay in the loop](#stay-in-the-loop) to hear about our first events.

## Stay in the loop
When the club emerges from it's chrysalis :bug: -> :butterfly:, we'll advertise events through the [Jean Golding Institute mailing list](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/join-our-mailing-list/), we'll advertise the dates right here, and I'll [tweet about it at #DataEthicsClub](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataEthicsClub?src=hashtag_click).

## Get Involved
If you're interested in joining us in organising, please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) or ping us a message on [our favourite data science Discord](bit.ly/data-discord)- you don't need to be in Bristol.
