# Meeting Dates 

Meetings are every two weeks on a **Wednesday** at 1pm.

The dates for upcoming meetings are here, but the discussion material will be voted for in the meeting before. 

We will meet on Zoom - the link will be sent out on the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hjkmnX), and on the individual meeting pages that you can click to below.
Each week we will try to provide a summary on Twitter or HackMD of what we discussed.
