### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday 28th April at [1-2 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club+-+We+created+poverty.+Algorithms+won%27t+make+that+go+away.&iso=20210428T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read [We created poverty. Algorithms won't make that go away](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/we-created-poverty-algorithms-wont-make-that-go-away)
by Virginia Eubanks (author of [Automating Inequality](https://virginia-eubanks.com/)), which is a short opinion piece in The Guardian about the role of AI in 'fixing' poverty and inequality.

Thank you to Matthew North for suggesting this week's content. Nina will be leading this week's meeting.
