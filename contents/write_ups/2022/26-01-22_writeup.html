<p class="admonition-title">What’s this? </p>
<p>This is summary of Wednesday 26th January’s Data Ethics Club discussion, where we spoke about the article <a class="reference external" href="https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/">Which Programming Languages Use the Least Electricity?</a> by David Cassel.</p>
<p>The summary was written by Huw Day, who tried to synthesise everyone’s contributions to this document and the discussion. “We” = “someone at Data Ethics Club”.

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The article investigates the question “Can energy usage data tell us anything about the quality of our programming languages?”, commenting on the research paper <a class="reference external" href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">Energy Efficiency Across Programming Languages</a>. In this paper, the researchers ran the solutions to 10 programming problems written in 27 different programming languages, while carefully monitoring how much electricity each one used — as well as its speed and memory usage. We discussed the methodology of the paper, the results and how it affected our view on coding in a more green way.</p>
</section>
<section id="are-you-surprised-by-any-of-the-results">
<h2>Are you surprised by any of the results?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-you-surprised-by-any-of-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>One of our members, Ben, pointed out some technical problems with the methodology of the paper, specfically, that the cache effects excluded.</p>
<p>The cache keeps frequently used data nearby for quick access.
This reduces the number of times you have to access your main memory and has a large effect on energy consumption.
This is one of the things that would have the most important impact on the output, but wasn’t considered in the paper.
As well as that, the problems which the authors chose to analyse were comparatively small in scale and complexity so would not be comparable to bigger, computationally intensive problems.</p>
<p>In summary, the problem is based on flawed assumptions, and could have been measured more holistically.</p>
<p>Some of us were suprised about the detail in the discussion, but not the results, generally that high level languages tend to use more energy.
There is a perspective missing about general sustainability.
For example, which languages do people make the most mistakes in?
This would mean having to consider recompiling the same problem over and over, and would have an impact on how efficient a language is overall.
Granted, this is a difficult thing to measure and but would be an interesting future study.</p>
<p>Others were not really sure what we expected, but our main expectations were C will be quite efficient and Python will not be.
Python is easier and more familiar to a lot of us so we do not want to go back to having to use C.
In reality, will the difference made by forcing everyone to write in C be worthwhile until billionaires stop launching themselves into space?</p>
<p>Perhaps the reduction in environmental impact by using C is cancelled out by everyone having multiple tabs open with “how do I do anything in C?” Many people are self-taught in coding and their teacher wasn’t very good. Is it fair for the purposes of this study to assume that everyone is a good coder?</p>
<p>Many of us use Python, but often it is actually using C under the hood.
There were also some of us who used R or C as well, other efficient options might include languages like Rust or Fortran.
We would have liked to see comparisons to numpy/pandas.
For example, NumPy is available in Python and uses C but they didn’t include this - essentially it is possible to reduce our impact by being thoughtful about the tools we are using, even if the language itself isn’t the most efficient.</p>
<p>Essentially, the closer a language is to how a computer “thinks” the more energy effecient they tend to be, but at the cost of being harder for people to learn and implement efficiently.
For the average coder, this means that there will be a tradeoff when using more effecient but harder to work with languages.</p>
<p>One member shared an example of an individual program used repeatedly being optimised from <a class="reference external" href="https://bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-software-engineering/case-studies/minimalmarkers/#d.en.578273">University of Bristol’s Advanced Computing Research Centre</a>:
“The Research Software Engineering (RSE) Group worked with Dr Gary Barker, a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences, to speed up a Perl script that he developed to find the minimal set of genetic markers needed to differentiate all samples in a genotyping dataset. After 10 days of work, the software was accelerated by over 25,000 times (figure 1). This reduced the runtime for identifying the minimal set of markers to distinguish different varieties of wheat from about 10 days to just 34 seconds!”</p>

<h2>Is changing our programming practices an effective way to reduce our environmental footprint?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-changing-our-programming-practices-an-effective-way-to-reduce-our-environmental-footprint" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of any technical issues of the study, many of us came to the conclusion that nothing from this paper at all should affect how we go about coding.</p>
<p>Should we be thinking more carefully about which programming problems we even attempt to tackle and perhaps focussing on important and useful problem instead of training more and more useless models? Should energy metrics be reported alongside accuracy metrics? If all computational number theorists stopped computing or even if they just switched from Python to C, would that be better?</p>
<p>There is great value to fundamental research even if it is not immediately apparent and so we should be cautious about cutting corners in research.</p>
<p>Not everyone has access to run expensive time consuming models, and realistically it is management level decisions about things like which cloud services to use that could have a lot of power to change the environmental cost of our outputs.</p>
<p>This paper feels quite out of context from these wider contextual considerations.
What papers like this seem to encourage is 15-20 of us is to ditch Python and go to C and doesn’t really address bigger organisational actions that could really effect our power usage.</p>
<p>Realistically, how would this paper be applied? Maybe this sort of study (perhaps with some technical adjustments) could be done within a large institution to consider the energy cost/loss.</p>
<p>There are no limits on hardware/software that stop you running out your battery immediately/using loads of energy. User experience can be a competing requirement. There is a risk of premature optimisation.</p>
<p>Are there better things to optimise? Not everything needs to be smart, e.g. kettles, lamps, BBQs. Reusable code will be able to be better optimised - reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Policy is very focused on the energy source of heat and transport, but not on digital technologies and how they use the energy.</p>
<p>Any discussion about energy efficiency needs to include big companies. There exists a dichotomy between prioritising research (for the benefit of society as opposed to personal profit) vs being energy effecient. Potentially we want to have a different discussion about whether colonising other planets is energy efficient.</p>
<p>Could we offer companies an audit on energy usage and/or do they need to use machine learning? Because more often than not, they don’t.</p>
<p>High vs low level languages: how much of what is actually being run by the computer is being hidden from you. A key example is memory management: you don’t need to delete arrays that you’re finished using to make sure that you’re not keeping those arrays in memory any more.</p>

<h2>Are some jobs just not worth doing?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-some-jobs-just-not-worth-doing" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We also thought about the coding infastructure and the amount of electricity involved. Do these need to be considered? Is this a “useful” component in this economy? Is it time to admit that some jobs are just not worth doing? What if it is more efficient to just not do them?</p>
<p>This kind of research has a place within that and is a relevant consideration but has to be put into context. In Scotland there was a consideration to extend working from home (not just for pandemic reasons) and some media outlets tried to undermine the pollution factor at play.</p>
<p>How much has this problem been thought of before?
Coding and coding infrastructure is probably not top of the list when we think of climate change.
This paper does highlight that computational resources is worth thinking about.
But we should also be mindful about resources used to make computers, as we discussed in a <a class="reference external" href="https://dataethicsclub.com/contents/write_ups/2021/11-08-21_writeup.html">previous talk</a>.</p>
<p>Speed is a good proxy for energy consumption. But if we make things faster then people might just run them more ofter. For example, creating more energy efficient fuel sources created more fuel consumption. This is an example of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox#:~:text=In%20economics%2C%20the%20Jevons%20paradox,rises%20due%20to%20increasing%20demand.">Jevons’ paradox</a>.</p>

<p>What is the point of us being more efficient with coding when we’re flying internationally for our jobs?
Every little helps but is it too difficult to make a significant impact on a larger scale?
Overall we were divided about this, with some of the group believing individual action cannot supersede industrial energy wastage, and others believing that it is worth doing what we can millions of individuals to make an impact.</p>
<p>We are incentivised to drive cars, which is part of the reason it continues to happen.
Is it the programming language or the context (architecture? libraries? CI? RStudio/Jupyter notebook?).
Maybe we should be optimising libraries rather than the people using them.
Why not get a plug in for your code editor that tells you how much energy you have used in each session by re-running bits of code as you develop?
Other solutions like this are already in place.
At Graphcore it tells you how much CO2 a job will take before you run it - at least then you are aware of how much energy you are using.
People are either horrified or totally desensitised to it.</p>
<p>Ultimately this piece gave us an opportunity to reflect on our own individual energy usage but brought us back to the idea of corporate responsibility versus individual action.</p>
