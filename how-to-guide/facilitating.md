# How to run a Data Ethics Club meeting

Typically we have a brief introduction to the material, split everyone into breakout rooms of 5-6 people for 25-30 minutes to talk about the discussion questions, and then come back together for the final 15-20 minutes to share thoughts before voting on the material for the next meeting. 

We use the collaborative markdown site [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) to collect everyone's views on the content whilst we're in breakout rooms. Our templates for this are linked below.  

## Roles and getting involved
We tend to have separate responsibilities split into facilitating and organising, and we swap these roles around each meeting.  
The **facilitator** is responsible for leading on the content,  managing the discussion in the meeting and writing up the summary of the meeting.  
The **organiser** is responsible for sending out emails, setting up the templates and managing participants and breakout rooms in the meeting.  
  
### I'd like to be an organiser of Data Ethics Club
We'd would love to hear from people interested in organising! Please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) and let us know. We'd especially like to hear from PhD students/early career researchers and people who are usually under represented in data science. 

### I'd like to lead a session on a particular topic
Brilliant! Please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) to let us know and we can set this up with you. 

## Before the meeting

### For facilitators
- [ ] Choose the material to discuss from the [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md). We suggest voting on this in the previous meeting!  
- [ ] Decide on three questions around the piece to discuss.  
- [ ] Create a [meeting information file](./../meetings/meeting_template.md) in the `meetings/` folder with links and the three discussion questions.
- [ ] Have a 3-minute verbal summary of the material ready in case nobody in the meeting is prepared to volunteer one.  

### For organisers
- [ ] Update the [meeting overview file](./../MEETINGS.md) with a link to the new meeting information page.
- [ ] Set up a new [HackMD document](./templates/HackMD_meeting_template.md) for collaborative writing in the meeting. 
- [ ] Send a one-week reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions. We usually also include a link to last week's discussion.   
- [ ] Send an on-the-day reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions.  


## Meeting Structure
Meetings are typically 1 hour.  
  
**0-5 mins**   
  🟢 Allow people to trickle in and say hi.  

**5-10 mins**   
  👋 Welcome everyone to the meeting. 
  - Once everyone has arrived, invite a 3 minute summary of the content for discussion (not everyone will have had a chance to read it). If no one volunteers you may need to do this yourself!  
  - Post a link to the Code of Conduct and the HackMD collaborative document and do a quick reminder of any key points.  
  - Allocate people randomly into breakout rooms, with 5-6 people in each group.   

**10-40 mins**  
  💬 Everyone chats in their breakout rooms. Keep an eye on the main room for any latecomers who need to be assigned to a breakout room.  

**40-55 mins**  
  💬💬💬 Bring everyone back to the main room and invite summaries from each group. Hopefully this will provoke some discussion (we usually find we run out of time because of it!). 

**55-60 mins**  
  📊 Run a feedback poll.
  We usually ask:  
  - Did the material provoke interesting discussion?  
  - Would you recommend this piece to another group?  
  - Vote on what to discuss next time (from a shortlist).   

## After the meeting  
- [ ] Update the meeting information file with the outcome of the poll and a link to the summary document.  
- [ ] Move the meeting on the overall meeting list, and make the next one!  
- [ ] Sync the HackMD document with the repository to capture the discussion as it was written. 
- [ ] Edit the HackMD document into a summary of the meeting.
