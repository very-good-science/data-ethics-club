Everyone is welcome to get involved in _Data Ethics Club_, as much or as little as you'd like to! We would love to [hear your point of view at our discussion groups](#upcoming-meetings), to have your support in [organising or running a meeting](organising), or to add your [contributions](contributing) to our reading list.  

You don't need to be a data ethicist (we're not!), or a data scientist - having a variety of different people is how we learn from each other. It's a friendly and welcoming group and we often have new people drop by, so why not try it?  

In term time, we meet every other week for one hour on Teams (Wednesdays, 1pm, UK time) to talk about something from [the reading list](../reading-list).
Our upcoming meeting dates are available below.

### Summer Book Club

For our summer 2025 bookclub, we will be reading [AI Snake Oil: What artificial intelligence can do, what it can't and how to tell the difference](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/starting-reading-the-ai-snake-oil) by Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor. 

On their website you can read the [first chapter online for free](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691249131/ai-snake-oil#preview), see [what each chapter is about](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/i/148742314/whats-in-the-book) and see the [suggested exercises and discussion prompts by the authors](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-snake-oil-exercises-and-discussion) to get an idea of the kinds of conversation we might be having.

There are 8 chapters and the exact schedule is below. We'll be meeting 4-5pm UK time on Microsoft Teams, meeting details here:

**Next meetings**:

#### 6th August Chapter 6 - Why can't AI fix social media? (48 pages)

Suggested discussion prompts:
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a content moderation system with highly specified rules? What do you think about a content moderation system that gives more autonomy to content moderators?
2. Of the many ills that have been blamed on recommendation algorithms, which ones could algorithmic choice conceivably combat? Which ones are structural and can’t be solved through the lens of individual empowerment?
3. What did you think of Mark Zuckerberg's position that the amplification of problematic content is a natural phenomenon (fig 6.6)?

#### 13th August: Chapter 7 - Why do myths about AI persist? (31 pages)

Suggested discussion prompts:
1. One difference between AI research and other kinds of research is that most AI research is purely computational, and doesn’t involve (for instance) experiments involving people or arduous measurements of physical systems. In what ways does this make it easier to have confidence in the claims of AI research? In what ways does it make it harder?
2. What techniques do you personally use to stay grounded when you hear of seemingly amazing AI advances in the news? Discuss with your peers.
3. What are some ways to improve accountability for companies making unsubstantiated claims? These could include legal remedies as well as non-legal approaches. 

#### 20th August: Chapter 8 - Where do we go from here? (27 pages)

Suggested discussion prompts:
1. The chapter makes the point that broken AI appeals to broken institutions. What are some examples of broken institutions enamored by other dubious technologies? Is there something about AI, as opposed to other technologies, that makes it liable to be misused this way?
2. What impact do you think AI will have on your chosen or intended profession in the next five to ten years? What levers do we have to steer this impact in a way that is positive for society?
3. Look up some examples of AI-related legislation or regulation recently enacted or being debated in your country. Discuss the pros and cons of specific actions and proposals, as well as the overall approach to AI policymaking.
