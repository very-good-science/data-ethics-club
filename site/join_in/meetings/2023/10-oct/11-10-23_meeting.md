### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday 11th October at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 

It's our first meeting back for Autumn and we're really excited to see you all! 

Since we don't have a previous vote to use, the organisers have taken the liberty of choosing the material to discuss this week. 
We're going to be talking about the ethics of loyalty card data, and the privacy implications that come with that. 

[You can read an introductory post about the topic here](https://www.privacycompliancehub.com/gdpr-resources/loyalty-cards-virtual-try-on-tools-and-facial-recognition-technology-is-retail-the-next-sector-to-be-hit-by-a-privacy-scandal/) 
by Emma Sheppard at the Privacy Compliance Hub.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Were you aware how much your shopping data is tracked by shops and supermarkets? How do you feel about it?  
- Do you think the discounts offered by shops for using a loyalty card are a fair exchange for tracking your data?  
- "[Walmart's] chief financial officer revealed advertising was faster growing than the company’s main retail business and had higher margins" - what do you think about this?
