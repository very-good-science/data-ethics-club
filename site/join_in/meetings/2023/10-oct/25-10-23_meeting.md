### Description
Please join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday 25th October at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in!

This time we're going to discuss [How influencer ‘mumpreneur’ bloggers and ‘everyday’ mums frame presenting their children online][content] by Catherine Archer, which is a paper about about the attitudes of regular and influencer mothers towards sharing images and information about their children online. 

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- What (if anything) concerned or surprised you about the attitudes of everyday mums? Why?
- How effective are the tactics used by each group for maintaining children's privacy in your opinion?
- Do you have any comments on the research itself, e.g. limitations or things you would have liked to see?
