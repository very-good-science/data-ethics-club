### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday the 15th December at 1pm UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+A+Question+of+Truth&iso=20211215T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
Note that we will not be running an event as planned on December 1st due to the [UCU Strike Action](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11872/Universities-to-be-hit-with-three-days-of-strikes-in-December).
This time we're going to watch [Question of Trust](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00ghvd8) by philosopher Onora O'Neil, which is a lecture and Q&A about accountability and trust and the tension between transparency and surveillance. 

Thank you to Charles Radclyffe for inspiring us to add this to the list.
If you're looking for further reading on this topic, you might want to look at [this paper](https://philarchive.org/archive/NGUTISv2).
