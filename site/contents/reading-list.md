# Reading list

```{admonition} What is this Reading list?
:class: tip
The reading list contains all the suggestions for what to read or watch, contributed by members of the Data Ethics Club community. We choose from this list what to vote on to discuss for future meetings. 
We'd also love it if this reading list was useful for other people in starting their own journal clubs, or for any other purpose.

We would love suggestions for new reading materials, or better ways to categorise them ([open an issue](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/new) or [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk)). 
```

```{admonition} Key
:class: attention
- 🎤 = audio only
- 🕰️ = waiting for paper to drop
-  ✅ = we've discussed it
- 🔒 = Not Open access
- 📺 = Watching/Listening material
- [1] = A longer piece of work, we'd need to choose a chapter or section.
- [2] = A shorter piece of work, perhaps to combine with something else


Note: reading materials appear once in the category we felt they fit best.
