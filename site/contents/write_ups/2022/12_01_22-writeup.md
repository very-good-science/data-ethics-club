## Happy Birthday to Data Ethics Club!

This meeting marks a whole year of Data Ethics Club and so we decided to do something a little bit different, especially as it lined up with New Years. We have spent the past year discussing and debating various issues within data ethics and adjacent fields. With many of us coming from academic backgrounds, we can find it easy to spend a lot of time complaining without actually addressing any issues. In this talk, we talked about the ways we (both as individuals and as a collective) can make our little dents in addressing some of these issues we have discussed, debated and learnt about over the past year.

## Why is what we do important?

The rules of arithmetic are objective, but the way we use them are not, which leads to inevitable divide between theory in practise. We have to make important decisions about where we spend our money, where we have our conferences and where we put our attention. Data science is just a tool to help us make these decisions.

Maybe the question is 'what are we going to commit to **not** doing' or 'what are we going to call other people out for doing?'. How do we stand up to your superiors, and justify refusing to do something? This is especially difficult in commerical environments. We have found that, as individuals, it is difficult to stick your head above the parapet - you need to have a bit of a community to fall back on. Building a community where you can discuss ethical issues and fall back to is vital for getting more people to act more ethically, even if it is an uphill battle sometimes.

How can we be activists? Making statements to the university etc. Do we want to consider a mission statement? Do we want to encourage development of ethical courses?
We as a group should think about what kind of impact do we want to have? Recommendations, running courses, 

Data ethics club has the potential to act as a support group. We do not necessarily have all the same views but having data ethics as an important component of our professional practice brings us together. Communities are important to help us improve our own behaviour, holding us accountable whilst supporting us through changes.

A lot of the problems we have discussed over the past year have arrived because there has been nobody present to question people's ethics. Ethics always pertains to structures of power, vested interests and conflicts that pertain to these things. The whole point of data ethics club is to advocate for data science practitioners to practise their craft in a more ethically sound way. Of course, we don't want just a focus on STEM. We need people to be ethical in using data across other fields such as sociology and philosophy.

How do we affect change? We can't change things just from inside universities - they don't work like the rest of the world! We need to consider other outreach options. Ben wrote to Bristol Cable (a community led news source) and they published his article [Opinion: Engineers can’t ignore social responsibility](https://thebristolcable.org/2017/08/social-responsibility-engineers/). This is just one example of how we can speak out about issues in the data ethics field.

## Reaching Out

Spend enough time working on anything in an academic environment, surrounded by likeminded people invested in your topic, it can be neglect making what you do and talk about accessible to non-specialists. Academics in particular suffer with this problem. Addressing some of the problems we have talked about in data ethics club will require a lot more people talking about it than subject specialists.

Huw's resolution is to give outreach talks to schools talking about Data ethics and Weapons of Maths Destruction. If the talks inspire the next generation of STEM specialists to be more data ethically conscious, this is brilliant, but even if this does not happen, it is enough to start conversations about this sort of topic. Additionally, Huw has been beating around the bush about writing some data ethics related blog posts. Time to get to it.

Alastair was think has started thinking about ways he can encourage students and other learners to consider the ethical context of their work. Statistical mishandling is often forced error by the environment of academia that we're in and it is very easy for academic fraud to creep in. How do we teach and warn against this in the context of academia in a practical way?

Our very own Natalie wants to publish more Data Ethics content (e.g. how to run your Data Ethics room, Data hazards), aiming to doing even more to make the formula we have at Data Ethics Club replicatable. Natalie also wants us to shy away less from more technical reading material at Data Ethics club, potentially suggesting some relevant reading. Natalie is also considering running teaching sessions for undergraduates on Data Ethics. 

Vanessa hopes to run some practical sessions during Data Ethics meetings. Vanessa plans on writing a hate piece on the Metaverse, a piece we are all very excited for. Vanessa is also going to look into [Is debiasing bad?](https://edri.org/our-work/if-ai-is-the-problem-is-debiasing-the-solution/), understand the arguments and potentially make use of them in her thesis if relevant. Roman wants to write an article about ethics education in computer science.

Nina wants to publish a [Data Hazards](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-hazards/) analysis of her projects on the Open Science Framework.

## Balancing saltiness and sweetness

Ola's resolution is to, as she put it, balance saltiness and sweetness in her approach to academic reading. This is not just because of politeness. Rather than being bitter and defensive against academic reading, is there something to do be done to make the reading about the author and not your own ego? How do we learn to love reading again and not see it as a chore? 

Ola will be trying to take a slightly more positive outlook on things whilst still being thorough. Paper reviewers could benefit from this too! This idea resonated with lots of members of the group, who missed the days when they could genuinely read for joy instead of just for work. Unfortunately PhD students are just being optimised for picking out "what can I get out of this?" from any source they read from

Ola also mentioned the [civic labratory](https://civiclaboratory.nl/2021/01/03/collabrary-a-methodological-experiment-for-reading-with-reciprocity/), a group asking themselves: "How can we change academic reading relations that tend to be extractive into something more reciprocal, humble, generous, and accountable?"

This led us to asking if there is a dichotomy between being nice and being pessimistic? You don't always have to read to evaluate, unless you're doing a systematic literature review. You can just read, as if it was a fiction book. Maybe asking different questions might make it better. Can you read for how the author arrived at arguments? What claims did they make? What were they supported by?

This is not just about being a nicer person. If your own wellbeing suffers from being a bit salty, maybe you need to learn to enjoy reading again. Film snobs tend to enjoy films less, maybe we reading snobs should learn to enjoy reading again.

## Blowing the Whistle and Looking at Jobs

One of our members, Euan has intents to "blow the whistle" this year in his field. His studies are not being listened to, even though it would make things safer in his field. Euan intends to try and continue to look for opportunities to apply more of what we learn at Data Ethics Club to what he is doing.

This also could mean examining exit routes out of academia. A lot of the career paths in academic are not looking as appealing, even if the actual work is good. Is there a way to integrate ethical behaivour into data science consultancy, perhaps even making it part of the brand? Stay tuned!

Heather also is considering a job change, but is struggling with finding job oppurtunities in areas she considers ethical. In the future at data ethics club we hope to have a discussion on ethical job hunting and what it means for a job to be ethical. Roman also wants to stay responsible when entering the job market as he finishes his degree.

Ben wants to be braver about calling behaviours out as well as being more prescriptive (should/must) because its morally wrong to do the other option (sit back and do nothing). Mia wants to be more willing to have difficult conversations with colleagues and be more comfortable in those uncomfortable discussions. Beverly hopes to build a stronger community and start to use their voice more.

## Showing up and giving back

Tashi hopes to take part in more of our data ethics club sessions as well as be more active as an Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) representative at the University of Bristol. Tashi hopes to do this by running student surveys to find views on EDI, among other ideas.

Sergio plans to continue participating and taking a more active role in the club by suggesting reading material. 

Our very own Nina wants to find ways to use funding that gives back to, and includes, communities. Nina also hopes to do the "Me and White Supremacy" workbook and consider how to incorporate anti-racism in her own work. 

## Stay tuned!

We hope to report back on the work of members of the data ethics clubs and potentially even come back to these resolutions come January 2023 - stay tuned!
