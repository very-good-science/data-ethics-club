### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday the 14th April at [1-2pm BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+Identifying+gaps%2C+opportunities+and+priorities+in+the+applied+data+ethics+guidance&iso=20210414T13&p1=299&ah=1).
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read the UK Statistics Authority's very recent (March 2021) publication [Identifying gaps, opportunities and priorities in the applied data ethics guidance landscape](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/identifying-gaps-opportunities-and-priorities-in-the-applied-data-ethics-guidance-landscape/). They're looking for feedback on this review, and we thought it might be a nice chance to have some influence on their future activities. 

Patricia Holley suggested this week's content and Natalie will be leading the meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the material, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading:
- What did you think about the suggested topics (Annex B)? Is there anything there that you think deserves a particular highlight, or anything that you feel is particularly missing? Do you use any particular tools/frameworks for assessing the ethics of your own work?
- What kinds of positive changes do you think it’s possible for the UK Statistics Authority to influence? Are these kinds of resources useful to you in your work, or merely a box-ticking exercise? What do you think would be most useful to you in making your area of work more ethical?
- Did you notice any gaps in the applied data ethics landscape (Annex A)?
