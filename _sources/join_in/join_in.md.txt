Everyone is welcome to get involved in _Data Ethics Club_, as much or as little as you'd like to! We would love to [hear your point of view at our discussion groups](#upcoming-meetings), to have your support in [organising or running a meeting](organising), or to add your [contributions](contributing) to our reading list.  

You don't need to be a data ethicist (we're not!), or a data scientist - having a variety of different people is how we learn from each other. It's a friendly and welcoming group and we often have new people drop by, so why not try it?  

We meet every other week for one hour on Zoom (Wednesdays, 1pm, UK time) to talk about something from [the reading list](../reading-list).
Out upcoming meeting dates are available below. 
If you would like to get email reminders about the content and dates for the next meeting then click below to join our mailing list! 

Please read our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct) before attending.

### 25th September
Material: [ChatGPT is Bullsh*t](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5)

Discussion questions: 
1) Do you think that the labels of ChatGPT as a bullshit machine is fair?  
2) Do you think ChatGPT is a soft or a hard bullshitter? I.e. do you think it has the intention to mislead its audience or not?  
3) What do you think of the implications of the anthropomorphizing of AI tools? E.g. hallucination, learning, training, perception etc.  

[Read the writeup here!](https://dataethicsclub.com/write_ups/2024-09-25_writeup.html)

### 9th October
Material: [Time to reality check the promises of machine learning-powered precision medicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30200-4/fulltext)

Discussion questions:
1) How should we more meaningfully assess applications of ML to medicine (and other fields)?
2) Why do you think most of the reviewed ML methods are producing classifications (i.e. diagnosed or not diagnosed) instead of predicting a continuum of risk?
3) Do you think precision medicine itself is an epistemological dead end? What about stratified medicine? (identifying and predicting subgroups with a better and worse response)

Writeup: Coming soon!

### 23rd October
Material: [Transparent communication of evidence does not undermine public trust in evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9802351/)

[HackMD Link](https://hackmd.io/@data-ethics-club/r1z0N3sy1l/edit)

Suggested discussion questions: 
1. Were you surprised by the findings of the study? Do they mirror experiences in your own domain?
2. What do you think is behind the difference between the results of the nuclear power study and the vaccine study?
3. Should research articles have a place in persuading the public, or should their intention always be to focus on robust, trustworthy information? 

### 6th November - DEC Special!
To be decided.

### 20th November
To be decided.

### 4th December
To be decided.
