### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [22nd February at 3pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 

This week we're reading [Limits and Possibilities for “Ethical AI” in Open Source: A Study of Deepfakes](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3531146.3533779): a Nature news article by 
David Widder and colleagues. David will also give us a short talk about this work (hence the different time!)

We really look forward to seeing you!

Here are our discussion questions, provided by David:  
* Data Ethics Club is a community run open source project. What other ethical concerns might arise that are more unique to corporate-sponsored open source projects?  
* Why do we think conversations about Ethics in AI often focus on design principles, such as Fairness, Accountability, or Transparency, instead of what systems are used for? (or, do we agree with this assertion at all?)  
* What other ethical considerations are there, positive or negative, when considering whether to open source new AI technology?
