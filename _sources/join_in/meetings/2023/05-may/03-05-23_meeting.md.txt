### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday 3rd May at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Queer in AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI][content] which is joint authored by the Queer in AI community. It describes the group's purpose, organisational methods and the initiatives it leads. 

It's a rich piece of work with lots of content, so we suggest focussing on Section 2 and 3 (pages 4-8) which are about the marginalisation of queer people in AI, and the Core Principles of the Queer in AI group. 

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Do you have any examples/experiences of data collection or use that may have contributed to the marginalisation of queer people. If you were involved, could you have done something differently, and what were the barriers to this?
- Decentralised organising is core to the Queer in AI approach. Is this a style of organising you are familiar with? If you are inclined to think it is a useful/not useful approach, why is that?
- What would it look like to prioritise intersectionality in our personal work contexts - what types of initiatives might we see?
