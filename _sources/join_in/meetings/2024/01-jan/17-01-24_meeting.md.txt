No content this week - we'll be thinking about our Data Ethics New Years' Resolutions! 

### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [17th January 2024 at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 


For our first meeting of the year we usually think about what our resolutions are going to be for the year ahead,
and we could try to achieve them. 
Those of us that came last year can check back to see if we managed to achieve the resolutions we made then!  

If you join any meeting this year, make it this one!  

Looking forward to seeing you there.
