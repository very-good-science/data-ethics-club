# Data Feminism Book Club 2024

__What are we reading?__ [Data Feminism by Catherine D'Ignazio and Laura F. Klein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547185/data-feminism/)

We will be holding weekly meetings over the summer to help us all stay accountable and to discuss
our thoughts on _Data Feminism_ - a classic data ethics text that many of us have probably had on our
`to read` lists for too long!  

Remember you will need to get yourself a copy of the book. 
If you need help finding a copy then email Nina at nina.dicara@bristol.ac.uk.
