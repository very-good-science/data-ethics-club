# How we organise

We try to do all our organising and administration out in the open, so that:
1. We're forced to be organised, which means everything is easy for us to find, and it's easy to show people our plans.
2. Anyone with an interest can understand how we make decisions, so that people can feedback on our processes to help us improve and refine them.
3. If anyone wants to [get involved with organising](#get-involved), they can more easily.
4. If anyone else finds these materials useful, they can use them. If you're thinking of setting up a discussion group, we have a [How-To Guide](../how_to/reuse_dec) to help you make use of everything in the GitHub repository.

You can see what we're up to by looking at the [Issues](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues) (which functions as a to-do list) and our [organiser's meetings agendas](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/tree/main/agendas) on our GitHub repository.
 

### Organising team tasks
We share the following tasks:
- Planning and administrating future meetings (e.g. setting up Zoom links and calendar invites)
- Website + GitHub repository maintenance 
- Communications (sending out email reminders for the Data Ethics Club newsletter, and advertising through newsletters/Twitter/Slack)
- Writing up previous meetings
- Leading meetings (welcoming people, ensuring everyone gets a chance to speak, etc)

You can read more about the roles we play during a meeting in our [`How To` section](../how_to/reuse_dec). 

### Join us as an organiser
If you'd like to help us organise, too, we'd love that! 
You don't need any special skills (we are happy to show you around GitHub), or to be at the University of Bristol, and we can divide tasks based on your skills/interest.
We currently spend roughly 2 hours work per month (in addition to attending the Data Ethics Clubs meetings).
 
If you'd like to join us, please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) and let us know!
