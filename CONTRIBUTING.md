## *How* to contribute

[//]: # (TODO: Have a guide here to the way that the website is organised)

y are a little thin, so if you'd like to help please get in touch with us, please [send us an email][dec-email] and we will help you to find what you're looking for!

### Contributing on GitHub
If you find an [issue][issues] that you'd like to help with, then please:
1. Comment on it before you start working, so we don't repeat work.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository to your own GitHub account
3. Check that you are happy with the changes by [building the site locally](#build-the-site-locally).
4. Then, once you've made your changes, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request): we'll review it as quick as we can 😄.


### Build the site locally
In order to build the site locally, you'll need to run the following from your root directory:
`sphinx-build site/ site/_build/` 

These require some Python packages to run. 
You may want to set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first, so that you don't install these packages system-wide.
Then you can install the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
